# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

Welcome to the Rock-Paper-Scissors game, a simple and fun website where you can play the classic game against a computer! This project is designed to provide a delightful break in your day with a bit of nostalgic gameplay. All of the charming artwork you see in the game has been hand-drawn by me, bringing a personal touch to this digital experience.

## How to Play

Playing is easy! Visit my website, and you'll be presented with three options:
- Rock
- Paper
- Scissors

Click on the hand representing your choice, and the computer will move. The rules are straightforward:
- Rock crushes scissors.
- Scissors cuts paper.
- Paper covers rock.

If your choice beats the computer's, you win the round! (or you just got lucky)
